# Analysis on stock market investments


## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this project is to analyse stock market tendencies over few years based on privided data to determing betbest investment opotunities. And refactore the code to make it more efficiant.

## Results

analisys of performantce of different stockes on the stock market ([Figure 1](https://github.com/xenia-e/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resourses/all_stocks_2017_table.png) and [Figure 2](https://github.com/xenia-e/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resourses/all_stocks_2018_table.png)) shows the overall crash of market in 2018, with only two stocks that performed well (Enphase Energy (ticker ENPH) and Sunrun (ticker RUN)

Refactoring of the existing VBA code hellped as iprove execution time almost twice. See figures 3 and 4.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
